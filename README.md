**AdtechplatformsEngine: Unlocking Efficient Adtech Platforms**
===========================================================

The AdtechplatformsEngine is a cutting-edge, Rust-built platform designed to streamline and optimize adtech operations. By providing a scalable, modular, and highly configurable architecture, this engine empowers advertisers, publishers, and adtech vendors to build, integrate, and manage complex digital advertising ecosystems.

The AdtechplatformsEngine addresses the pressing need for a unified, high-performance platform that can handle the complexities of modern adtech, including real-time bidding, data management, and supply-side platform (SSP) integrations. By leveraging Rust's memory safety guarantees and performance capabilities, this engine ensures fast, reliable, and secure processing of large-scale adtech workloads.

Key benefits of the AdtechplatformsEngine include:

* Improved adtech workflow efficiency and scalability
* Enhanced data management and analytics capabilities
* Increased transparency and control over adtech operations
* Faster time-to-market for new adtech products and services

**Key Features**
---------------

* **Real-time Bidding (RTB) Engine**: Built using Rust's Tokio framework, the RTB engine supports high-performance, low-latency bidding for large-scale ad exchanges.
* **Data Management**: Leverages Rust's ownership model and borrow checker to ensure data integrity and security, while providing a flexible data schema for custom integrations.
* **Modular Architecture**: Designed for easy integration and extension, the engine's modular architecture enables seamless addition of new adtech components and services.
* **Supply-Side Platform (SSP) Integrations**: Pre-built SSP integrations for major adtech platforms, including Google Ad Manager, Amazon Advertising, and AppNexus.
* **Advanced Analytics**: Built-in support for advanced analytics, including data warehousing, ETL, and machine learning integrations.
* **Security and Compliance**: Implementing industry-standard security protocols, including encryption, access controls, and GDPR compliance.

**Technology Stack**
--------------------

* **Rust**: The engine is built using Rust 1.49, leveraging its memory safety guarantees, performance capabilities, and modern concurrency features.
* **Tokio**: The Tokio framework provides a robust, async-friendly foundation for the RTB engine and other performance-critical components.
* **Diesel**: The Diesel database library is used for database interactions, providing a type-safe, async-friendly interface.
* **Rust-HTTP**: The rust-http library is used for building high-performance, async HTTP client and server applications.

**Installation**
--------------

1. Clone the AdtechplatformsEngine repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/AdtechplatformsEngine.git`
2. Install Rust 1.49 or later: `rustup install 1.49`
3. Install Tokio: `cargo add tokio`
4. Install Diesel: `cargo add diesel`
5. Build the engine: `cargo build`
6. Run the engine: `cargo run`

**Configuration**
----------------

* Environment variables:
	+ `ADTECH_PLATFORMS_ENGINE_DB_URI`: The database connection URI (e.g., `postgres://user:password@localhost/adtech_platforms_engine`)
	+ `ADTECH_PLATFORMS_ENGINE_API_KEY`: The API key for secure API access
* Settings:
	+ `adtech_platforms_engine.toml`: A configuration file for engine settings, including database connections, API keys, and logging settings.

**Usage**
------

The AdtechplatformsEngine provides a comprehensive API for interacting with the engine's features. For example, to create a new ad campaign, use the following API call:

`POST /campaigns`



API documentation is available at `<http://localhost:8080/docs>`.
